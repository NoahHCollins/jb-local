    "- The bad news is that as expected the upwind scheme is less accurate, and relatively speaking this gets worse as the resolution is changed due to the first-order vs second-order accuracy of the two schemes [see homework exercise].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This manifests itself through enhanced (i.e. higher levels of) *numerical diffusion* with upwind methods, which can be particularly seen in it artificially thickening the width of the boundary layer, or equivalently limiting how fast the numerical solution can vary between grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The good news of course is that the scheme is stable (does not suffer from wiggles or undershoots) even when the mesh is very coarse (you could try coarsening it even further!) and the central scheme has gone unstable.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important point:** What's the worse situation: (a) instability and obviously a solution we shouldn't make use of; or (b) a stable but potentially inaccurate result? In many ways (a) is \"cleaner\" - instability tells us we are asking too much of the simulation and we either need to use more resources (bigger computer or a longer runtime) or scale back our ambitions, but sometimes neither of these things is possible. Then we need to resort to (b), but this is only safe to do if we are aware and understand (and better yet can quantify) the consequences of the limitations to the method. Problems arise when people follow option (b) blindly, with no appreciation of the issues related to spurious numerical behaviour such as the numerical diffusion we've seen here."

    "So, the effect of the (central) spatial discretisation is to modify the propagation velocity of the Fourier mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is termed a *lagging phase error*, or a [*dispersion error*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_dispersion) where \n",
    "shorter (less well-resolved) waves propagate too slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical dashed line indicates the Nyquist limit - this demonstrates that the shortest resolvable waves on the mesh actually do not propagate, and if we attempt to represent even shorter waves they actually propagate in the wrong direction!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Only very well resolved modes (the left of the plot with a $y$ axis value of close to 1) propagate at close to the correct speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to see this is to attempt to advect an initial condition with a relatively steep jump (imagine a top hat function) - the sharp jump can be thought of as being a summation over Fourier modes of different frequencies - the sharper the jump the higher the frequencies in this summation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the continuous problem all these modes propagate at the same speed (non-dispersive behaviour), and so the solution even with a sharp jump moves together without changing shape and without any misalignment of the individual modes leading to \"wiggles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to dispersion errors in the spatially discretised system these modes move at wrong and different speeds, and the single sharp jump in the solution will thus break up - leading to errors in the numerical representation of the jump and its propagation, as well as oscillations/wiggles propagating away from the jump, and based on the comment above the highest frequency modes could actually propagate in the opposite direction to the advection direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that oscillations in a numerical solution close to high solution gradients are sometimes called *Gibbs oscillations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of this in the following cell where we attempt to advect with central differences an initial condition with a sharp jump.\n",
