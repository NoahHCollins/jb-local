    "Assume that a soil flow can be approximated as a Bingham plastic. Consider a layer of soil on a slope which can be assumed to be infinitely wide and long. The layer is 1 m thick and is at an angle of 30¬∞ from the horizontal. Assume that it is initially at its angle of repose, which implies that the yield stress is just able to balance the gravitational force down the slope. After heavy rain the yield stress of the material decreases by 20%.  \n",
