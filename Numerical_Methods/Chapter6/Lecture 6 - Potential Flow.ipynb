    "### Good Approximations for Potential Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "One type of situation where potential is a good approximation is when the potential exerts a \"force\" on the quantity being observed, such as an electrical current or a fluid volume. The resistance to the flow is proportional to the flow-rate of the conserved quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good approximation for a number of systems: \n",
    "- Heat Flow\n",
    "- Electrical Current \n",
    "- Saturated flow in porous media\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow in Porous Media\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used in a wide range of systems such as:\n",
    "- Packed bed catalytic reactors\n",
    "- Water flow in aquifers\n",
    "- Petroleum reservoirs\n",
    "- Porous electrodes in flow batteries and fuel cells\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often characterised by a permeability, $k$, with viscosity as a separate term in order to separate the porous media and the fluid effect: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\large{\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla P}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this velocity is the superficial velocity (volumetric flow rate per area of porous media) rather than the actual average velocity of the fluid. The porosity of the media is the factor by which the superficial velocity will be lower than the average fluid velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However it does get more complicated for multi-phase flow in porous media due to the introduction of relative permeabilities that are a function of volume fraction of that phase in the pore space and capillarity (forces due to surface tension) can further complicate the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Random motion can also lead to potential flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion is a good example. Thermal motion of molecules in a solvent leads to molecules of the solute being randomly nudged (__Brownian motion__). At the microscopic scale, heat flow follows a similar process as the kinetic energy of the particles is randomly transferred to neighbouring particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "If particle motion is random, the number of particles leaving a small volume in a given time will be proportional to the number of particles in the volume. The number of particles entering will be proportional to the number of particles in the neighbouring regions. This will results in a net flow down a concentration gradient. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diffusion through a random walk \n",
    "\n",
