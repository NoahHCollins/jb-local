    "## Learning objectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To review what we've seen several times already on finite difference approximations to derivatives, how to derive them and how to estimate errors. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "* To review the numerical solution of advection-diffusion problems (steady and unsteady) using upwind and central difference methods and the very distinct accuracy/stability properties of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and recognise some of the issues that result from rapid (relative to the mesh resolution) variations in the solution - e.g. the presence of sharp boundary layers, and how this related to *stability*. To understand how a move away from uniform mesh resolution is one way to alleviate these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* To understand ***three key stability issues*** - where these come from and how they can be \"managed\".  One of these is the *cell Peclet number* related issue from the previous lecture, while the other two relate to the time derivative and limiting the *speed of information propagation* on the discrete mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To consider how eigenvalue analysis of the discretisation matrix can be combined with theory we saw for ODE solvers to consider stability issues for PDEs."

    "shorter (less well-resolved) waves propagate too slowly.\n",

    "The vertical dashed line indicates the Nyquist limit - this demonstrates that the shortest resolvable waves on the mesh actually do not propagate, and if we attempt to represent even shorter waves they actually propagate in the wrong direction!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Only very well resolved modes (the left of the plot with a $y$ axis value of close to 1) propagate at close to the correct speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to see this is to attempt to advect an initial condition with a relatively steep jump (imagine a top hat function) - the sharp jump can be thought of as being a summation over Fourier modes of different frequencies - the sharper the jump the higher the frequencies in this summation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the continuous problem all these modes propagate at the same speed (non-dispersive behaviour), and so the solution even with a sharp jump moves together without changing shape and without any misalignment of the individual modes leading to \"wiggles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to dispersion errors in the spatially discretised system these modes move at wrong and different speeds, and the single sharp jump in the solution will thus break up - leading to errors in the numerical representation of the jump and its propagation, as well as oscillations/wiggles propagating away from the jump, and based on the comment above the highest frequency modes could actually propagate in the opposite direction to the advection direction.\n",

    "Note that oscillations in a numerical solution close to high solution gradients are sometimes called *Gibbs oscillations*.\n",
