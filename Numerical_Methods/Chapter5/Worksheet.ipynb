    "We mentioned that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be potentially suppressed by surface tension. The bigger the disturbance, the less the surface tension is able to supress it. The maximum size of a disturbance is the width of the container, $d$. The other factors are the surface tension $\\gamma$, gravity $g$,  and the two densities $\\rho_h$ and $\\rho_l$. You can ignore viscosity as a factor that is only relevant once the system begins to move.\n",
